Problem Description

You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] + A[j] = B and i â‰  j.
Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.
Note - The pair (i,j) is same as the pair (j,i) and we need to count it only once.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= B <= 109

Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.

Output Format
Return an integer.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
B = 8
Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
B = 3
Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
4
Example Explanation
Example 1:
The only pair is (1, 2) which gives sum 8
Example 2:
The pair which gives sum as 3 are (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3) and (3, 4).
